# obsidian-snippets

This repo contains css-snippets I use to make my obsidian a litte bit prettier

## How to install:

Download the CSS-Files and copy them to the snippets directory inside your vault.
You can find this folder by opening Obsidian and navigating to 
`Settings -> Appearence -> CSS-snippets -> 📁 [Open snippets folder]`

After that your Vault should look like this
```
[YOUR VAULT]/.obsidian/snippets/
  header-indicators.css
  header-margins.css
```
After copying the files you should can activate the snippets in the appearence settings.

## Header-Margins

Increases the spacing above and below headings to make them more distinguishable from the rest of the text.

## Header-Indicators

Adds indacators so that the headings can be better distinguished from each other.

## Known Bugs

- The indicators are also displayed in front of formatting, so `# Heading with *Formatting*` gets displayed as "`H1` Heading with `H1` *Formatting*"
