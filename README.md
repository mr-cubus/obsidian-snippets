# obsidian-snippets

This repo contains css-snippets I use to make my obsidian a little bit prettier


**Header-Margins** increases the spacing above and below headings to make them more distinguishable from the rest of the text.

**Header-Indicators** adds indicators so that the headings can be better distinguished from each other.

Before:

<img src="resources/img_before.png" style="max-width: 50%; height: auto; border: 1px solid black;">

After:

<img src="resources/img_after.png" style="max-width: 50%; height: auto; border: 1px solid black;">

## How to install:

Download the CSS-Files and copy them to the snippets directory inside your vault.
You can find this folder by opening Obsidian and navigating to 
`Settings -> Appearance -> CSS-snippets -> 📁 [Open snippets folder]`

After that, your Vault should look like this
```
[YOUR VAULT]/.obsidian/snippets/
  header-indicators.css
  header-margins.css
```
After copying the files you should activate the snippets in the appearance settings.

## Known Bugs

- The indicators are also displayed in front of formatting, so `# Heading with *Formatting*` gets displayed as "`H1` Heading with `H1` *Formatting*"
